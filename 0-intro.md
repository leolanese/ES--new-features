Working in New Technologies is quite demanding, yet very rewarding. More and more of the production libraries and frameworks we use
to create our applications are going to be written using this new version of JavaScript. Instead of waiting on the sidelines, 
``we can start using ES* new features now`` with the help of transpilers/babel (webpack), and enjoy many of the benefits without
worrying about browser compatibility.

## Goal of the Workshop:
1. Introduction to new ES7(2016), ES8(2017), ES9(2018) and ES10(2019) features.
2. How to use these features today.
